  <LetterLabelDeathclawPasses>Deathclaw is roaming nearby!</LetterLabelDeathclawPasses>
  <LetterDeathclawPasses>This creature is also known as the "Living Nightmare of the Wasteland." Its claws are coveted prey for madmen who believe they can outsmart death.\n\nAt first glance, the Deathclaw appears to be just a giant lizard, but the Wasteland has a dark sense of humor. Its camouflage is flawless, and its killing speed exceeds your ability to realize you're already dead.\n\nDesperate hunters sometimes try to tame it, but it most often ends with their last words—"It can't see me..."—remaining unanswered. Those who miraculously manage to subdue this monster don't get a pet; they get a personal executioner with a very specific sense of humor.</LetterDeathclawPasses>

  <LetterLabelStrangeDutenPasses>Strange Dooten is roaming nearby!</LetterLabelStrangeDutenPasses>
  <LetterStrangeDutenPasses>In a world where radiation has turned cockroaches into dog-sized monsters and mosquitoes into personal helicopters of death, this mutant has managed to outdo them all. Meet the Strange Dooten—an insect so large its shadow blankets entire settlements, so vicious that even super mutants double-check if the door is locked, and so resilient it will survive nuclear winter, a headshot, and the very concept of hope.\n\nOnce, it was an ordinary dooten—if you consider "ordinary" a creature the size of a stool that feeds on radiation and human fear. But after devouring a warehouse of experimental stimulants, a couple of energy cells, and, rumor has it, an Enclave scientist (well, protein is protein), evolution decided to play a joke. Now, it's a flying tank with wings that:\n- Glows so brightly it could serve as a beacon for ships (if there were any ships left in the Wasteland);\n- Buzzes louder than the engine of a crashed helicopter (and breaks down just as often);\n- Attacks with everything it has: stinger, claws, acid, plasma, and pure, unadulterated hatred.\n\nWhy hasn't it been killed yet?\nGood question. Bounty hunters tried—their last words were usually, "I'll just blast it with my shotgun... OW." Raiders tried to tame it—their base now looks like a buffet. Even the Brotherhood of Steel once sent a squad after it—they returned without a paladin but with new phobias.</LetterStrangeDutenPasses>

  <LetterLabelHugeBeeArrived>Giant Bees are circling nearby!</LetterLabelHugeBeeArrived>
  <HugeBeeArrived>Genetic experiments, radiation, and nature's cosmic joke have led to these striped horrors no longer just pollinating flowers—they methodically destroy everything that dared to evolve without their permission. Their buzzing isn't a sound; it's a mockery of your pathetic attempts to survive. They build their hives from the debris of your homes, their larvae feed on your hopes, and their venom dissolves not only flesh but also the very will to resist.\n\nThey are faster than your bullets, smarter than your traps, and angrier than a hungover super mutant. While you hide in your bunker, they've already stolen your supplies, pollinated your garden (now something with teeth grows there), and set up your dog on a date with their drone. Congratulations—in a week, you'll either have a new mutated pet or some very terrifying memories.\n\nThe only way to fight them is total annihilation. With fire, acid, or a nuclear charge (though the latter only excites them). Or just accept it—soon your tombstone will read: "Here lies [YOUR NAME]. Posthumously pollinated."</HugeBeeArrived>

  <LetterLabelDuten>Dooten are circling nearby!</LetterLabelDuten>
  <DutenArrived>This monstrosity of mutation—likely descended from a horsefly or botfly—has perfected nature's most disgusting survival strategy. The Wasteland's answer to overpopulation.\n\nReproduction? Oh, it's efficient. Forget mating dances—this creature fires live larvae like biological artillery. One hit, and congratulations! You're now a walking incubator. (Pro tip: Fire helps a lot with... the brood situation.)\n\nApproach with caution—or better yet, with a flamethrower. Their idea of "family bonds" includes turning your ribcage into a daycare.\n\n"The circle of life, they said. It's beautiful, they said. LIARS"—last words of a Wasteland "beekeeping enthusiast."</DutenArrived>

  <LetterLabelWatcher>"Watcher 011" has spared your settlement... For now</LetterLabelWatcher>
  <WatcherProtection>You were stuck in the usual post-apocalyptic chaos—raiders at the gates, crops dying, settlers whining about a "radroach infestation" as if the world hadn't already ended—when it happened. The air grew thick. Static charge grated in your teeth. The shadows stretched unnaturally, as if reality itself held its breath.\n\nAnd then... nothing.\nNo raider attacks. No mutated creatures gnawing at the walls. No sudden radiation storm turning your brahmin into glowing mutants. Just... silence. Unnatural. Ominous. The kind that even local drug addicts freeze mid-injection and mutter, "This ain't right."\n\nTurns out, Watcher 011 was just passing by.\n\nYou didn't see it—of course, no one ever does. But you felt it—that nasty sensation of being examined, weighed, and deemed... worthy of attention for now. Maybe it pitied you. Maybe your suffering amused it. Or maybe it needs your settlement to survive for some incomprehensible cosmic joke.\n\nBut here's the catch:\nYour food supplies are untouched (Incredible).\nYour turrets didn't fire a single shot (Suspicious).\nYour settlers are alive (Which, frankly, is disappointing).\n\nDon't celebrate just yet. Watchers don't help. They observe. And sooner or later, they always return—usually just when everything is about to go to hell.\nSo enjoy the calm while it lasts. And maybe start stockpiling flamethrowers. Just in case.\n\n"Always welcome"</WatcherProtection>

  <LetterLabelCargoPodWatcher>"Watcher 011" just dropped something.</LetterLabelCargoPodWatcher>
  <CargoPodWatcher>Maybe it was an experiment. Maybe an act of mercy—if such a concept even exists for these beings. Or maybe it just dropped this while passing by, like a human dropping crumbs without noticing the ants.\n\nBut here's the catch:\nWatchers don't help. They observe.\nAnd if they brought something... it means they need you to use it for something.\n\nSo celebrate. Stock up. Fortify.\nAnd wait.\nBecause they always return—usually just when their "gift" turns out to be the final piece of the puzzle in someone's incomprehensible game.\nIn the meantime... maybe check these gifts for hidden traps?\nJust in case.</CargoPodWatcher>

  <RadroachEatersLabel>Radroach Infestation.</RadroachEatersLabel>
  <RadroachEatersDesc>Filth, chaos, and typical post-apocalyptic squalor have led these radioactive pests to evolve—and now they're not just devouring your pathetic food supplies but also mocking you. Yes, their chirping isn't just noise; it's actual taunting commentary about your worthless life. They multiply faster than your settlers die, their shells are tougher than your will to live, and their bites leave behind not only rotting flesh but also a deep sense of humiliation.\n\nAnd the worst part? They're smarter than you. While you dig through dirt for food, they've already stolen your supplies, eaten your dog, and left a radioactive "gift" on your bed. Congratulations, now you have either diarrhea, a mutation, or both.\n\nThe only way to get rid of them is fire. Lots of fire. Or just accept that this is their world now, and you're merely a temporary food source.</RadroachEatersDesc>
