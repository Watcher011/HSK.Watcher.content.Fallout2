<BugArt.description>The monument's true life lies within. The entire structure is teeming with radroach figurines. They don't just stand on the surface—they're part of the vortex. Thousands of ecosystems, cast in phosphorescent epoxy resin for network technology, create the illusion of a seething, living tornado. Their backs flicker in the darkness with a dull, ominous green light, and their tentacles and legs merge into a single stream, echoing the swirling lines of the storm.</BugArt.description>
