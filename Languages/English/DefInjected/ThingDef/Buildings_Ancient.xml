  <GECKPump.description>G.E.K.K. is a portable agrocomplex, enclosed in a shockproof case made of polished glass and bulletproof glass. The device was developed as part of the pre-war state program "New Eden" for the rapid restoration of agriculture on fragile soils. Unlike stationary agricultural complexes, G.E.C.K. could be quickly deployed in any place where oases of fertility were made a strategic resource.</GECKPump.description>
