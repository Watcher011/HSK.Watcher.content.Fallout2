  <!-- «Скорпоник» — энергетик с характером! -->

  <Scorponade.label>"Scorponade" Energy Drink</Scorponade.label>
  <Scorponade.description>*"Because regular energy drinks are for wimps! True wastelanders only drink 'Scorponade' - the revolutionary beverage made from 100% pure rad-scorpion venom, lovingly distilled through an old gas mask and a pinch of desperation!
**Why you'll love it:**
 3 seconds and you won't feel tired anymore. You won't feel anything at all.  
 Unique "fiery" taste (that's not spice - those are your taste buds dying).  
 More energizing than a laser rifle shot to the backside!  
 Endorsed by the Vault-Tec Medical Association (though the last doctor screamed "NO!" before slipping into a coma).  

**Side effects may include:**
- Spontaneous muscle spasms (your body will dance without your permission).  
- Temporary blindness (but what amazing hallucinations!).  
- The sensation of being trampled by a brahmin... three times.  
- Unexplainable cravings to eat fire ants.  

**Usage instructions:**
1. Shake well (if the bottle moves on its own, that's normal).  
2. Chug immediately (sipping slowly might lead to realization).  
3. Avoid operating machinery for 48 hours (or until you stop seeing sounds).
