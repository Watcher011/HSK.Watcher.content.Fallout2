    <label>Nuclear shot, with set time</label>
    <labelShort>Big Alarm Clock</labelShort>
    <description>Has a 5-second timer. Does not detonate on impact with other objects, allowing it to ricochet off walls and around corners. A projectile that directly hits an enemy also deals damage, in addition to the subsequent explosion.</description>
